Project Summary:
The project we created is a simplified version of Blackjack also known as 21. Blackjack is a traditional casino banked game, meaning players compete against the house rather than each other. However, in our version, there is only one player against the computer. The objective of the game is to beat the earlier. 
To beat the dealer, the player must: 
1) Get a hand total that is close to and not over 21 
2) Either outscore the dealer by getting blackjack 
3) Have the dealer bust by going over 21. 
However, if a player's hand is over 21 or less value than the dealer's hand, the player automatically loses the game. 



Features of the Program:
The system will allow a player to play a hand of blackjack against a computer-controlled dealer
The player is dealt with 2 random cards
If the sum is less than 21, the player has the option to either hit or stay
If the player decides to hit, then another random card is dealt to the player
If the player decides to stays, then no cards are drawn, and the dealer and player cards are revealed
If the dealer’s sum is equal to 21, and the player’s hand is smaller or greater than 21, the player automatically loses
If the player’s sum is equal to 21 and the dealer’s hand is lower or greater than 21, the player wins
If the player’s sum is closer to 21 than the dealer’s sum, the player wins
If the dealer sum is greater than the player sum, and less than 21, the dealer wins

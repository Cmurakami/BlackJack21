Project Summary:
The project we created is a simplified version of Blackjack also known as 21. Blackjack is a traditional casino banked game, meaning players compete against the house rather than each other. However, in our version, there is only one player against the computer. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to or equal to 21 as possible, without going over 21. 

To beat the dealer, the player must: 
1) Draw a hand value that is close to and not over 21, and is higher than the dealer’s hand value.
2) Outscoring the dealer by getting a blackjack on the first two cards, when the dealer doesn't
3) Have the dealer bust by drawing a hand value that goes over 21.

However, if a player's hand exceeds 21 or if the dealer's hand has a hand value that is closer or equal to 21, the player automatically loses the game. On the other hand, if the dealer and player both end up with the same hand total value it leads to the round being a tie.


Features of the Program:
1. The system will allow a player to play a hand of blackjack against a computer-controlled dealer
2. Player will bet money against the dealer.
3. The player is dealt with 2 random cards 
4. The dealer reveals one card to the player and the player must decide whether to stand or hit regarding the given information
5. If the player decides to hit, then another random card is dealt to the player, and has to make the decision to either hit or stay with this new information given
6. If the player decides to stays, then no cards are drawn, and the dealer and player cards are revealed
7. If the dealer’s sum is equal to 21, and the player’s hand is smaller or greater than 21, the player automatically loses
8. If the player’s sum is equal to 21 and the dealer’s hand is lower or greater than 21, the player wins
9. If the player and dealer hand totals both equal the same amount, then it is a tie (push)
9. If the player’s sum is closer to 21 than the dealer’s sum, the player wins
10. If the dealer sum is greater than the player sum, and less than 21, the dealer wins
11. Depending on who wins, the winner receives the wager amount.
